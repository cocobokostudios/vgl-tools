# vgl-tools
Video Game Library (VGL) tools that provide extended functionality to the [vgl-app](https://github.com/cocobokostudios/videogamelibrary).

These tools are written as a way to experiment with potential services that could be provided to further enhance the application experience, but may not be part of the baseline application.
